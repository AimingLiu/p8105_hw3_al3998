# Load the data from the p8105.datasets

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

``` r
  aisle_form = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
  aisle_num = nrow(aisle_form) 
```

It can be concluded that the row number of aisle is 134 and the most
items ordered from fresh vegetables

# Making a plot

``` r
  aisle_form %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle,y = n,fill = aisle))+
    geom_col()+coord_flip()+
  labs(
    title = "Plot about the number of items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "number of items",
    y = "aisle" ,
    caption = "Data from the instacart")+
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
